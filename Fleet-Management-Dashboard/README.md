# Fleet Management Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Fleet Management Power BI Dashboard designed to analyze fleet performance, operational efficiency, and cost drivers. The dashboard enables decision-makers to monitor vehicle utilization, control operational costs, and identify optimization opportunities through data-driven insights.

## Business Objectives
- Monitor vehicle utilization and overall fleet performance
- Analyze operational and fuel-related costs
- Identify cost inefficiencies across vehicles
- Track performance trends over time to support planning and optimization

## Key Insights & Findings

### 1) Fleet Utilization & Performance
- Significant variation in vehicle utilization rates highlights underutilized vehicles that can be reassigned or optimized.
- High-mileage vehicles contribute disproportionately to total fleet activity, indicating potential overuse and higher operational impact.

### 2) Cost & Fuel Efficiency
- Fuel and operational costs represent a major portion of total fleet expenses, with noticeable differences across vehicles.
- Cost-per-mile analysis reveals vehicles that generate higher costs relative to usage, signaling efficiency gaps.

### 3) Operational Efficiency & Cost Impact
- Analysis highlights vehicles with consistently higher operational costs relative to mileage, indicating performance inefficiencies.
- Cost-per-mile metrics help identify vehicles that require closer monitoring or operational adjustments.

These insights support better fleet optimization and cost control decisions.

### 4) Time-Based Trends
- Time analysis shows fluctuations in mileage, fuel consumption, and operational costs across different periods.
- Monthly and yearly trends support forecasting future expenses and improving planning accuracy.
